# SuperDuo

This is the third project of Android Nanodegree course at Udacity.
It consists of two separate projects - book-scanning application and football-score application.
The goal of this project is to productionize two apps, taking them from a functional state 
to a production-ready state. 

What should be done:
* find and handle error cases 
* add accessibility features
* allow localization 
* add widgets
* add a library
